""" Generic Configuration File For Training Pipeline on CIFAR10/100

This file will be used to set an instance of the Model class from model.py

Here are defined 7 Dataclasses:
    * Dataset
    * Dataloader
    * Model
    * Optimizer
    * Scheduler
    * Train
    * Distillation

A final "Meta Data Class" Config is defined, which contains the 7 dataclasses.
This meta dataclass will be used to instanciate a LightningModel.

****
Note on implementation:

Since lists and dicts are mutable objects in Python, they should not be used as default
arguments of class.
Thus it is not possible to set a mutable default argument.
However, we think in this context we can safely do it.
That's why we use a little workaround in order to so, by using the fied function from the
dataclasses standart library.
One can assume that in this context:
> default_list_attribute = field(default_factory = lambda: the_default_list)
is equivalent to:
> default_list_attribute = the_default_list
